# Dino-Code-

Duration - I spent 6 hours but I took some time to comment and to get it zipped 

My high score - 1046

Complications - JUst trying to get it zipped I forgot how to zip files so that's on me 

Docummentations - I used a lot of resources but none of them actually contributed to the final code. The only docs that was actually useful to the final code was the link you provided the rest was just testing the game and getting coordinates and learning how it operates.
